<div class="About"><p>Even as a tiny hatchling Tan was cute and funny. Well OK they all were. But as they got older and puberty hit the boys in particular became difficult! Male quails do not usually get on in groups as their fight for females literally leads to fighting! But Tan was a gentle boy and co-lived with another male longer than most. He also showed a love for luxury and soft things! He adored blankets and soft furnishings and would do his funny big-footed shuffle to get the spot comfy! There is nothing more adorable than seeing a quail relaxing, stretched out with their legs splayed out behind them!</p>
    <div class="quote">"He adored blankets and soft furnishings"</div>
<div class="About"><p>Tan in particular loved to relax this way and wasn't scared of anything!</p>
<p>Tan shared the best of two years with two ladies, Chi Chi and Skittles. Chi Chi was a big lady and sometimes dominated over poor Tan! Chi Chi and Skittles both past away at around 20 months old. Tan lived out the remainder of his days alone. But pampered! Sometimes spending his days indoors, having sand-baths and running around the house. Other times outdoors in his pen enjoying the grass and sunshine.</p></div>
<div class="quote">"Tan adored cuddles and chin tickles!"</div>
<div class="About"><p>From a young age Tan was special amoung his kind. He stood out with his unique soft and gentle character. Tan adored cuddles and chin tickles! But only when HE chose. One day he was feeling very sorry for himself, having cut the top of his beak, and he loved getting the extra attention from his human family!</p></div>
